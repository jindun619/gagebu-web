# Gagebu Web

Gagebu Web is a personal finance management web application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to track their transactions and analyze their spending habits. The project is still under development and currently features two main pages: **Transactions** for displaying transaction lists and **Analysis** for visualizing financial statistics using the **Recharts** library. Data is fetched from the **Gagebu Backend** project (https://github.com/jindun619/gagebu-backend). The app is styled using **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** for a clean and modern design.
